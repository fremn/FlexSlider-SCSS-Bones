FlexSlider SCSS
===============

Rewritten base CSS for [FlexSlider v2.0](http://www.woothemes.com/flexslider) to gel with [Bones v1.25](http://themble.com/bones/)

By no means is this file perfect, I've simply converted all CSS to nested SCSS and used Bones / Compass mixins where possible.

Feel free to fork and fix where you see fit!

###Instructions

* **Option 1)** Clone the `/library` directory and replace your Bones v1.25 default `style.scss` (and add the FlexSlider v2.0 files to `/js`)
* **Option 2)** Add the code below to `style.scss` and manually add the individual files to your /library directory

`// styles in flexslider.scss`

`@import "flexslider";`
